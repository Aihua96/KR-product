# Proxmox VE Virtualization

> This page is an original synthesized overview based on public Proxmox VE materials. It highlights essentials for comparison inside the KR product portfolio. No verbatim copying.

## What is Proxmox VE?
Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) is an open-source enterprise virtualization and consolidation platform. It unifies KVM full virtualization, LXC system containers, software-defined storage (Ceph, ZFS, LVM, NFS, CIFS), software-defined networking (VLAN, VXLAN, SDN abstraction, BGP EVPN), backup/restore, and high availability into a single web-managed control plane.

## Key Value
- Cost efficiency: open-source core + subscription channel for stable repo & support
- Unified operations: VMs, containers, storage, network, access control in one UI
- Elastic growth: start single-node and scale horizontally to multi-node clusters
- Automation friendly: Web UI, CLI, REST API, JSON schema, ecosystem tooling
- Proven stability: large global community & long-term lifecycle maintenance

## Feature Matrix (Condensed)
| Domain | Capabilities | Notes |
| ------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Virtualization | KVM + LXC | Full isolation vs lightweight density |
| Clustering | Multi-node, HA, live migration | Corosync + pmxcfs for config sync |
| Storage | Ceph, ZFS, LVM, NFS, SMB, iSCSI, directory | Mix & match per workload profile |
| Networking | Linux Bridge, VLAN, VXLAN, SDN, BGP EVPN | Multi-tenant segmentation & overlays |
| Security | Firewall, role/ACL model, IPv4/IPv6, API tokens | Multiple auth realms (PAM/LDAP/AD/OIDC) |
| Backup | Full/incremental, scheduling, snapshot consistency | vzdump + Proxmox Backup Server integration |
| Automation | REST API, CLI, Terraform/Ansible ecosystem | JSON schema typed endpoints |
| Ops & UX | Web UI, logs/history, metrics, mobile access | Consistent CLI parity |

## Architecture Snapshot
Debian base with a customized kernel; pmxcfs (database-driven cluster FS) replicates configuration; KVM for near-native VM performance; LXC for high-density Linux workloads; optional Ceph or ZFS enables hyper-converged compute + storage.

## Typical Scenarios
- Private cloud / internal data center consolidation
- Edge or branch node lightweight clusters
- Mixed legacy (VM) + cloud-native (container) transition stages
- Lab, training, and test sandboxes with rapid cloning

## Relation to KRVIRT (Internal Mapping)
- Foundation Layer: Could act as an upstream hypervisor pool integrated by KRCMP
- Transitional: A source environment for migration or hybrid operation
- Complement: Rapid adoption in specific regions while building native stacks

## Subscription Highlights
- Enterprise repository for stable & security-updated packages
- Official escalation channel reduces MTTR
- Predictable lifecycle & upgrade cadence
- Compliance & audit friendly with recognized support traces

## High-Level Adoption Flow
1. Capacity & hardware planning (CPU virt extensions, memory, storage tiering)
2. ISO installation & base layout (optionally ZFS root)
3. Cluster formation (Corosync, node join trust)
4. Storage onboarding (local + Ceph/ZFS/LVM/NFS as needed)
5. Network abstraction (bridges, VLAN/VXLAN, SDN segments)
6. Resource templates (VM templates, LXC base images)
7. Access & policy (roles, firewall, tokens)
8. Backup strategy (schedules, incremental retention, off-node replication)
9. Scale & optimize (NUMA pinning, storage pools, network throughput)

## FAQ Snippets
**Performance?** Near-native via KVM + VirtIO; tuning with CPU pinning & NUMA awareness.

**Must use Ceph?** Not required initiallyâ€”can evolve from local/NFS to Ceph when scale demands.

**Why containers + VMs?** Avoid forced trade-offs: heavy isolation vs lightweight density on one substrate.

**Backup overhead?** Reduced by incremental streaming and sparse/ compression optimizations, plus Proxmox Backup Server.
